# Prisoner's 31 Game
Description:
The game is played with two players, and tries to simulate the idea of playing 31 but without the deck. In the game, drawing a card corresponds to both players showing a number with their fingers simultaneously from 1 to 5. The two numbers are added together and this is the value of the "card" the player drew. When playing a player "draws cards" until his points are at least 26. If he exceeds 31 points, he is burned. Players take turns playing. If the first player gets burned, the second player wins. If the second one gets burned the first one wins. Otherwise, the player with the most points wins. If they have the same number of points, the first player wins. Players play multiple rounds and alternate who is first and who is second. In the end, the one who has won the most rounds wins.
